Set up a TypeScript monorepo using pnpm workspaces with the following structure:

monorepo root
├── packages/core        (library, not an app)
├── packages/react       (library, not an app)
├── apps/web             (Vite + React SPA)
├── apps/docs            (placeholder for now)
└── tooling/tsconfig     (shared tsconfig base)

Requirements:
- pnpm workspaces configured in root pnpm-workspace.yaml
- Root package.json with scripts: build, test, lint, dev
- Shared tsconfig/base.json with strict: true, target: ES2022, moduleResolution: bundler
- Each package/app has its own tsconfig.json that extends the base
- Vite configured for apps/web
- packages/core builds to ESM + CJS via tsup
- packages/react builds to ESM + CJS via tsup, externalize react and react-dom
- Vitest configured at the root with coverage support
- ESLint with TypeScript rules configured once at root
- All packages use the workspace version of each other (workspace:*)

Output: All config files, no application logic yet. Just a clean, runnable scaffolding where `pnpm -r build` succeeds without errors.
